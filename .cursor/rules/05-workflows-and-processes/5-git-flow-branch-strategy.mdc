  APPLY GitHub Flow branching strategy for solo development WHEN planning features, implementing
  code, or managing development workflow to ensure clean linear history with rebase merges
globs: '**'
alwaysApply: true
---

- Create feature branch from `main`
- Use `feature/short-descriptive-name` format
- Work in small atomic commits
- Rebase feature onto latest `main`
- Fast-forward merge to `main`
- Delete feature branch after merge
- Keep `main` always deployable
- Use kebab-case for branch names
- Push feature branches for backup
- Force-push after rebase if needed
